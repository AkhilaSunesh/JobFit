# Resume ATS Scanner üìÑ‚û°Ô∏èüîç

## Problem Statement
In today's competitive job market, applicants often struggle to ensure their resumes stand out and pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Many resumes are rejected due to formatting issues, lack of relevant keywords, or simply not meeting the job description's requirements. There is a need for a tool that can help job seekers optimize their resumes, provide feedback, and compare multiple resumes against a job description to determine the best fit.

## Our Approach
We have developed a Resume ATS Scanner that allows users to upload their resumes in PDF format, get an estimated reading time, and receive a summary, ATS rating, and feedback based on the provided job description. The tool also allows users to ask specific questions about their resumes and compare multiple resumes to identify the best fit for a job.
